# Development Flow

## Scope
- Applies to all code changes in this repository.

## Workflow
- Define acceptance criteria before coding.
- Update validators/DTOs first, then services, then controllers/routes.
- Add error mapping and structured logs.
- Tests: unit for services/validators, integration for critical routes.
- Run lint + format + tests before commit.

## TDD
- Use TDD for complex business logic or high-risk changes.
- For simple wiring, implement first, test after.

## Commits
- Commit small, coherent changes that compile and pass tests.
- One topic per commit; avoid mixing refactors with features.
