# Testing

## Minimum
- Unit tests for services and validators.
- Integration tests for critical routes.
- Cover auth, permissions, and error cases.

## Tools
- Test runner: `jest` or `vitest`.
- HTTP tests: `supertest`.

## Rules
- No network calls in unit tests; mock repositories.
- Keep fixtures minimal and deterministic.
