# Code Style (KISS/DRY/SOLID)

## General
- Keep functions small and single-purpose.
- Prefer composition over inheritance.
- Avoid hidden side effects; be explicit about inputs/outputs.
- Reuse shared logic via utilities or services, not copy-paste.

## TypeScript
- Use `strict` mode; no `any` without explicit justification.
- Prefer `type` for DTOs, `interface` for contracts.
- Keep DTOs separate from persistence models.
- Do not leak ORM/DB types outside repositories.

## Naming
- `PascalCase` for classes/types, `camelCase` for variables/functions.
- Files and folders: `kebab-case`.

## Controllers
- Thin: validate, map, call service, map result, return response.
- No direct DB calls; no complex business rules.

## Services
- Business logic only; no HTTP/Express objects.
- Always return domain DTOs or primitives.

## Errors
- Use typed error classes for domain failures.
- One central error handler maps to HTTP status and response shape.
